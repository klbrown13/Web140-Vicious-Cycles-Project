				<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
				<p>At Vicious Cycles, we cater to the beginner. We have helped our customers foster a lifelong love of sport motorcycles. Some of the best things about riding a motorcycle are being able to travel quickly, meeting new friends and experiencing an adrenaline rush. Our team is full of experienced bikers. They are very knowledgable in sport motorcycles and building them. Some have even competed in competitions and won! We will service any bike purchased from us. Take a look at the types of <a href="service.html">services</a> we offer. We take great pride in our products and building trust in the community. We also believe in giving back to the community. We volunteer in multiple events. We have had classes on bike safety, and several programs for children and teens. </p>
				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Vicious Cycles was created in 2010. We are a store that caters to beginner bikers. I made my first bike in my parents garage. I was in a different state, when I wanted to have a fresh start. I moved to the Raleigh last year and it took some time to get my business going here. We first started in 2010 as a custom bike store. </p>
				<h2>About the Owner</h2>
				<p>I have worked with motorcycles for over 25 years. I was in school for mechanical engineering. My dream was to make my own motorcycle. After college I worked in several companies making motorcycles. I realized that I did not want to work under people forever. I wanted to be my own boss, and do what I want without asking permission. Once I made my own motorcycle, I decided to create my own business. My <a href="buildabike.html">Build a Bike</a> program is my favorite thing to do. I love seeing the look on the face of a customer when they see their finished motorcycle.</p>
